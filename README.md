# Murder-rate-of-2215-communities-in-the-U.S.
Suppose we are interested in studying the murder rate (per 100K people) of n = 2215 communities in the U.S. Our goal is to
predict the murder rate as a linear function of these attributes. For the purposes of interpretation, it would be helpful to 
have a linear model involving only a small subset of these attributes.
